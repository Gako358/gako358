### Gako358

Greetings, code enthusiasts! I am:

- A meticulous System Developer @hnikt | Fullstack Developer.
- A language polymath, with strong proficiency in C, Java, Python, and SQL.

As a Vim enthusiast, I'm continually seeking ways to refine my workflow and master the art of efficient coding. But remember, "With great power comes great responsibility!" so always remember to tread carefully or else one day you might find yourself screaming, "WHERE did all my data go?!"

`"Java Reflections are like trying to navigate a dark maze, where every turn presents a new NullPointerException." - a testament of my undying 'love' for Java.`
